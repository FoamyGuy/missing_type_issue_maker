There are missing type annotations for some functions in this library.

The `typing` module does not exist on CircuitPython devices so the import needs to be wrapped in try/except to catch the error for missing import. There is an example of how that is done here:

```python
try:
    from typing import List, Tuple
except ImportError:
    pass
```

Once imported the typing annotations for the argument type(s), and return type(s) can be added to the function signature. Here is an example of a function that has had this done already:

```python
def wrap_text_to_pixels(
    string: str, max_width: int, font=None, indent0: str = "", indent1: str = ""
) -> List[str]:
```

The following locations are reported by mypy to be missing type annotations:
